This project analyzes scientific publications from the OpenAlex API, focusing on three journals (Scientometrics, Quantitative Science Studies, Journal of Informetrics) from 2020 onwards. Using Python, it retrieves articles, filters them based on a large set of AI-related keywords (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, NLP, transformers), and computes yearly dynamics of selected papers. The results include a summary table displayed in the terminal and a CSV file with all filtered articles. This provides an automated and extensible way to explore how AI-related research trends evolve in scientometrics and related fields.
